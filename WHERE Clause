# SQL Practice Queries

This repository contains practice SQL queries for common tasks related to an `employees` table. Below are the details of the table structure and queries.

## Employees Table
- **Table Creation**: [Employees Table Schema](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mbK5aIyNru0WtG0e1nGPZVEVaC6xWf6-0kzhs4Wr1IQ/edit?usp=sharing)
- **Insert Records**: [Insert Records into Employees Table](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kIBs9w90Y-r0iU2LqlqsuhN9VAXlGJqpXnbK-NXaLV4/edit?usp=sharing)

## Practice SQL Queries

### 1. Display all records of employees whose `joining_date` is after 20 March 2022.
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE joining_date > '2022-03-20';
```

### 2. Display `emp_no`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `department` of employees whose department is 'Finance'.
```sql
SELECT emp_no, first_name, last_name, department 
FROM employees 
WHERE department = 'Finance';
```

### 3. Display `emp_no`, `salary`, and `department` of employees whose salary is below 35,000.
```sql
SELECT emp_no, salary, department 
FROM employees 
WHERE salary < 35000;
```

### 4. Display all records of employees whose `birth_date` is on or after 24 January 1998.
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE birth_date >= '1998-01-24';
```

### 5. Display `emp_no`, `first_name`, and `department` of employees whose department is not 'IT'.
```sql
SELECT emp_no, first_name, department 
FROM employees 
WHERE department != 'IT';
```

### 6. Display all records of employees whose `emp_no` is 1010 or below.
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE emp_no <= 1010;
```

### 7. Display unique `first_name` of employees whose gender is 'Male'.
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT first_name 
FROM employees 
WHERE gender = 'M';
```

### 8. Display `emp_no`, `first_name`, `salary`, and add 10,000 to the salary of employees whose salary is below 25,000. Display the updated salary as `final_salary`.
```sql
SELECT emp_no, first_name, salary, salary + 10000 AS final_salary 
FROM employees 
WHERE salary < 25000;
```

### 9. Display `emp_no` and the full name (as `full_name`) of employees whose `emp_no` is more than 1015.
```sql
SELECT emp_no, CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name 
FROM employees 
WHERE emp_no > 1015;
```
